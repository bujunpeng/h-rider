<p>
This project is the slighly modified version from the Git project 
https://github.com/NiceSystems/hrider/wiki  , I had to solve some compilation issues to make it working.
So I took freedom to correct those and I have staged here as a seperate project. I will be forking the original project soon.
This project will help you get started using the wonderful tool for your learning.
